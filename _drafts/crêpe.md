I'm lucky: growing up, every Saturday, my dad would make crepes for me and my sibling. 

But I'm even luckier: I've figured out how to make pretty good crepes myself, and it's an easy and indulgent treat many mornings, or for dessert when guests are over. 

Crepes are impressive and delicious, but they're also cheap, quick, and dead simple. You can make them in a non-stick or cast-iron pan, or, you can buy a traditional _bilig and_ feel like a real crepiere.

I double the recipe and keep it in my fridge for up to five days (it never lasts that long).

### Recipe

* 1 egg
* 1/2 cup flour
* 1 cup milk
* zest from 1/2 lemon
* 1 tbsp sugar
* pinch of salt

Combine all ingredients, in a blender, using a stick blender, or by hand with a whisk. Ideally, let it sit at least 1 hour for the gluten to develop.

### To Cook A Crepe

As you try Add Heat a non-stick or cast iron frying pan bilig (175°C or 350°F)

Add your filling of choice and either fold the crepe in half, three times until you have a perfect traditionally triangular crepe. Or, simply roll the crepe up into a long multilayered log.

### My Favorite Fillings

#### Lemon and Sugar

A classic: sprinkle granulated sugar on your crepe and then add the juice of 1/4 lemon, right before folding or rolling it up.

#### Jam and Cinnamon

My eastern-european ancestors crushed _Polichinkin_, a delicious rolled crepe filled with jam (apricot ideally) and dusted with fragrant powdered cinnamon.

#### Nutella

Duh.
