#### Set the Mood for a Delicious Dinner:

One of the best-kept secrets to entertaining at home is that you don’t need to be a good cook to be a good host. I host about ten meals a week, and whether it’s my supper club, Pith, or an impromptu lunch, I’m certain that the mood matters more than the food.

Most of my friends, it seems, avoid cooking and hosting at home out of performance anxiety. How can they, on moderate budgets and with limited time, possibly find the correct ingredients, the proper tools, let alone the ideal natural light, all needed to impeccably reproduce and document some latest popular recipe? They can’t — but it’s a myth that that a great meal requires flawlessly cooked food.

When I host, I end up devoting more energy to setting the right mood for a meal than I ever do actually cooking it. In the process, I’ve found myself less stressed, and my guests happier. It’s a more hospitable approach, less about showing off skills and more about receiving people as generously as possible.

#### **Set a glorious table**

No matter what space you’re hosting in, embellish your dining table and draw attention to it.

I try not to overcrowd the table by keeping each place setting minimal. Everyone gets a fork, knife, plate, cup, and wine glass, and I don’t change these throughout the meal. Tablecloths are expensive and easy to stain, but simple linen napkins add comfort and elegance. Having ice on hand for water and cocktails is a free way to boost tableside luxury.

Flowers can also add celebratory, sculptural, and organic bursts of beauty. I avoid overpriced technicolor ones in favor of simple bunches of wildflowers. One bunch can become three or four smaller arrangements that fill up a table yet keep guest’s faces visible to one another.

And don’t forget that final, necessary touch to any dinner table: a few bowls of ready-to-eat snacks. Whether olives, nuts, or bread and butter, they leave me free to finish preparing the main dishes as guests arrive.

#### Add ambience with dim lights and candles

Experimenting with lighting in your dining room will make any meal feel more intimate. Nearly all restaurants have dim lighting and tables with flickering candles for good reason — they draw attention away from a room’s messier corners and instead towards the table and the faces sitting around it.

More than anything, I recommend switching your lightbulbs to dimmable ones that [glow a delicate golden hue](https://amzn.to/2TAuZED), mimicking the warmth of natural flame. Avoid pointing all the light directly at your table, and perhaps place one or two floor lamps in corners to help light the room gently and evenly.

I’ve also invested in [giant candles](https://amzn.to/3anmALC) that burn for dozens of dinners. Fake candles just don’t cut it, and there’s a satisfying decadence to candles (and wine bottles) wearing down slowly throughout a meal. Plus, leftover wax is surprisingly easy to clean with a spatula and hot water.

#### Bump the music

Researchers call it “sonic seasoning:” studies consistently show that food really tastes better in a room with music playing. Background music can also lessen social inhibitions, making guests more comfortable to chat with one another. avoiding awkward pauses when I have to tend to dirty dishes or undercooked meat.

Whether you’re bumping music from your phone or a giant hi-fi system, pick a playlist with hours of music that you love, and check the volume ahead of time so that you don’t have to anxiously fiddle with the music throughout a meal. (If you want to tune into the sound of my own dinner parties, [here is the playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6WF8xZ4XMItYISVjbSzGKc?si=eMesobU6REqqlz_4MncOeg) I use practically every time I host.) Whatever you blast, rest assured it will concretely improve guests’ perception of your food.

#### Don’t fixate on mistakes

How you bring a dish to the table can make or break a meal far more than the dish itself. Nervously apologizing for overcooked chicken doesn’t exactly set the best mood**.** Cooking is hard — have pride in your creations!

When I radiate pride over a dish, I’m certain guests enjoy it more. Sometimes this means brightly reclassifying burnt carrots as charred. Sometimes it means bitting my tongue about overcooked pasta. Even if you have no music, no lights, even no damn table, just remember: if you’re happy, your guests will be.

Is it professional suicide for a home cooking columnist to claim that cooking may not actually matter that much? I don't think so — imperfection is in fact exactly what makes cooking at home so relaxing and fun. A bean stew, a $10 bottle of bourbon, and a smile will get you way further than anxiously following a trendy recipe.
