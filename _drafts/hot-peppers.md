### **How to make magic with a vegetable peeler.**

A cooking tool that does only one thing is best re-gifted to a hoarder with a big house. Goodbye, stray melon ballers, garlic pressers, and hard-boiled egg slicers: all these gizmos promise to make cooking effortless, but are actually pretty time-consuming to use, clean, and store. Instead, allow me to sing the praises of a small, inexpensive, easy-to-clean, and deceptively versatile tool, one that you probably already have: the modest vegetable peeler.

It’s nice to have a tool that easily removes tough, flavorless skins from root vegetables. But in my kitchen, it’s used for so much more. A vegetable peeler contains a unique blade that improves any home cook’s daily workflow, unlocking new textures and formats from ingredients in ways that would otherwise only be possible with excellent knife skills, cumbersome machines, or a fancy mandolins.

Now it’s earned a permanent spot on my kitchen counter—and it should be on yours, too. Here's why a vegetable peeler is every host’s secret weapon.

### **The one you need costs about $3**

Believe me: the very best vegetable peeler is plastic, brightly colored, and about $3. The timeless [Kuhn Rikon peeler ](https://www.amazon.com/Kuhn-Rikoma-Original-Peeler-3-Pack/dp/B083PQLPPT/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=fwjonahreiderveggiepeeler0220-20&linkId=169c8a32f5375edd1e69251e650601d1&language=en_US "(opens new window)")is Swiss-designed and one of the cheapest options available. It's the preferred peeler of countless professional chefs, and in a tight home kitchen, where cabinet real-estate counts, it’s even more valuable.

For years, mine has tirelessly cut through sinewy ginger, tender tomatoes, rock-hard cheeses, and everything in between. Because it’s virtually impossible to resharpen the blade on a vegetable peeler, some dulling is inevitable. I love that this one is easy to recycle and repurchase.

### **Serve hard cheeses the right way**

Forget flavorless and powdery pre-ground parmesan—hard cheeses are especially succulent when sliced into thin shards that dissolve on the tongue. A vegetable peeler does this effortlessly, but if you attempt these super-thin slices with a knife, any hard cheese is likely to crumble.

A bowl full of large flakes of nutty mimolette or aged pecorino is a totally respectable appetizer on its own. But when I’m hosting, I love to garnish pastas, salads, grains, and roasted vegetables with thin strips of any hard cheese. Don’t forget to save the rind for a delicious broth or stock.

This same dressing works beautifully over sliced ripe tomatoes, or mixed into a large chopped salad.

Chili-infused acids also cut through rich stews, add a burst of flavor to bland poached fish, and perk up an otherwise quotidian roast chicken. And with a splash of chili vinegar mixed in, thick yogurt becomes a zippy condiment of its own, perfect for soup-swirling and bread-dunking.

### How to preserve them in fat

Fats also do an excellent job at absorbing and preserving complex flavor from fresh hot peppers. I gently simmer olive oil or butter with salt, garlic cloves, and roughly chopped deseeded chilies.

Feel free to add spices—toasted cumin and coriander; crushed ginger and garlic, or fennel seed and citrus zest—but in general, I like to keep my spicy preserves relatively elemental, and thus, versatile.

Regardless, after about ten minutes of simmering, I let the infused mixture cool and reserve it in my fridge. A pat of chili butter in the pan upgrades everything from grilled cheese sandwiches to seared scallops to fried eggs. Chili-infused oil is perfect for drizzling over pasta, stews, and soups.

For a thicker and sweeter condiment, try adding some roughly chopped carrots in with the peppers, fat, and salt. Cook covered, at low heat, until the carrots have softened. Then mush it up into an extraordinary paste using a mortar and pestle, an immersion blender, or even a fork.

So in short, make hot pepper season last all year long: fill your fridge with preservations of any fresh chilies you can get your hands on.
