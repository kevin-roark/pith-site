Prado Restaurante (well priced excellent new Portuguese cuisine, superb wine); Sol e Pesca for chill snack or lunch or souvenirs if you like amazing canned fish; Taberna dos Mercadores for classic cuisine (tiny clams, salt baked fish, crispy octopus) really lovely but you'll likely have to put your name down and walk around while you wait...there's a lot of super heavy saucy food that I honestly didn't really like that much but finding the lighter farmer's market vibe stuff is so worth it
