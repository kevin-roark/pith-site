[patron.jp2](/images/patron.jp2 "patron.jp2")In the afternoon, the hills of Jalisco glow a cool blue. Steely succulents are planted in every direction — Blue Weber Agave, specifically — which means only one thing: tequila.

I was sixty miles east from the city of Guadelajara on a mission to better understand Mexico’s national elixir, one which previously brought to mind tropical cocktails and college hangovers. Every morning, the roads teem with small white trucks, each carrying two farmers and thousands of pounds of their trimmed, ripe agave. At night, 18-wheelers rumble in the opposite direction, bringing bottled tequila to an ever-growing global customer base.

The area is constantly busy because tequila production does not operate seasonally: agave can be grown, harvested, roasted, pressed, fermented, and distilled all year round. This process must take place within approved areas constituting only 5% of the entire country, using only one extra-sweet species of agave. These requirements, and the prohibitive cost of corresponding machinery, keep truly artisanal producers at bay — there are only about 100 tequila distilleries in Mexico compared to more than 27,000 wineries in France.

### Tahona Tequila is The Best Tequila

All this is not to say that artisanal methods don’t exist. I stayed at the Patron manufacturing hub for two days and witnessed their large and local workforce preserving traditional methods with an eye towards sustainability. Ripe, spindly agave (8 years old!) are wrestled from the ground and trimmed for their _piñas,_ white starchy hearts. When steamed for about three days, the starch in these _piñas_ become astonishingly sweet, an exotic cross between a pineapple and tamarind.

Traditionally, donkeys would then pull a two-ton volcanic stone _tahona_ over the roasted agave, crushing it slowly into a juicy pulp — but to minimize notes of donkey urine, producers now use a powerful electric motor to roll the stone. It’s evocative of other stone-grinding processes, like Italian olives being crushed into oil, or Japanese tea leaves being ground into matcha.

With this _tahona_ process, the agave juice and pulp is fermented together. The fiber rises to the top of the barrel, forming a protective blanket that adds flavor and prevents aromatic compounds from evaporating. It’s a slow, inefficient, and delicious process.

Sadly, very few distilleries use a _tahona_ at all, and even fewer release bottles derived exclusively from the process. Most tequila is instead made using industrially juiced agave that is strained and fermented in stainless steel tanks, yielding a muted flavor profile with a heightened sting.

Paton’s [_Roca _](https://www.patrontequila.com/products/roca.html)line of tequilas, for example, is made exclusively using this traditional _tahona_ process of juice pressed from roasted agave hearts; it has an assertive aroma and delicate flavor that pairs excellently with food.

#### Matched Only By Jalisco's Food Scene

The best restaurants in Jalisco are strewn alongside the highway, packed into a bustling city streets, or scattered along the perimeter of big markets. Each seller seems to have one or two specialities that everybody orders.

Some tortillas are delicate and soft; some are crispy and oozing with melted cheese. They might be topped with juicy beef tongue braised with green chilis. Or it could be a hunk of pork shoulder, spinning hypnotically and licked by flames. Or, crispy fried crickets, doused in lime juice, then stuffed into a small quesadilla.

Chopped white onion and cilantro garnish practically everything, but the addictively spicy and colorful salsas differ from one vendor to the next: jalapeños minced with onion and vinegar; intensely fruity habaneros blended with roasted red peppers; deeply toasted nuts and seeds blended with oil and red chilies.

At some point, I took a break from these rich bites to enjoy a small plastic bag filled with perfectly ripe watermelon and cucumber, seasoned with salt, lime juice, and chili powder. All of these snacks cost less than $10 in total!

One evening, I visited a Patron agave field to attend an ambitious and mysterious pop-up dinner. A chef was on site roasting massive sirloin steaks, peppers of all sizes and colors, and pale creamy squashes over an enormous wood fire. 60 guests had come from all over the world, had been gathered by Secret

#### But it goes perfectly with all types of home cooking and hosting

Tequila, particularly the tahona-produced _Roca_ line, went so well with these local delicacies. But after I came home to New York, I discovered how much I enjoyed serving it alongside all types of dishes.

The precise balance of fruit, smoke, and vegetal spice in _blanco_ unaged tequila makes it a perfect match for light fare like raw fish and acidic salads, and an alluring relief from richer and spicier stews and soups. The _anejo_ varieties, aged close to three years in oak barrels, have a warmth and texture to rival cognac for after-dinner sipping.

Just please forget about making the cloying tropical cocktails that completely conceal tequila’s subtleties. Instead, try substituting the spirit for gin or vodka to enliven any simple drink such as a dirty martini or a negroni.

Ultimately, I prefer simply sipping tequila — and you will too. Make sure to seek out brands working with the ancient _tahona_ juicing and fermentation process, and you’ll find yourself — and your guests — thoroughly impressed.
