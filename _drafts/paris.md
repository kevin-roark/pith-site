Below is a haphazard and ever-changing list of my favorite places to eat, drink, and shop in Paris.

Most of my recommendations are in the city's northeast quadrant, around the 2nd, 3rd, and 11th arrondissements. I personally adore this area, especially the 11th, probably because this is where most of my friends are, but also because it is far away from the most touristy destinations in the city, with a particularly lovely concentration of cheese shops, seafood stalls, bakeries, cafes, natural wine bars.

Yes, Parisians are curt and at times plainly rude. Get over it. This is a city full of grunge, glamor, and romance. And extraordinary cultural respect for quality food at its most basic. 

#### Cafés and Boulangeries

Don't waste time looking up the very best bakery or café: coffee and baguettes. The absolute best activity in Paris involves picking out a €1 baguette from a bakery sitting at a café 1 euro coffee is bracing, bitter, and just lovely at any single café. But don't get a single thing besides coffee. The nice croissants and baguettes are all sold at the bakeries scattered throughout .

A good croissant has a hard shiny shell (lacquered with butter with clear lines from being rolled) and an incredibly airy interior reeking of butter. The shop should smell like the inside of a movie theatre popcorn tank. Did I mention butter?

These cafés form the social core of Paris — go for a inky espresso in the morning, but come back for a glass of wine and a plate of fries or snails at lunchtime, and . It's not really worth stressing over finding the "best" one — the real joy is walking through neighborhoods 

#### Simple Lunching

Breizh Cafe I mean, galettes. These savory crepes are made from buckwheat galettes.

Café L'Empire

#### Cave à Vins

Many of Paris' most innovative and renowned restaurants have small wine bars affixed next door or a floor below. I prefer to visit these places, because they are cheaper, simpler, and faster. You can usually buy a bottle from their exceptional collections to go on your way out

Around 5pm I'll often just look up "cave a vins" in google and see if anything interesting is located close by.

Septime La Cave — the baby sister of fabulous tasting menu Septime and its seafood focused sibling Clamato. Here you can eat ruby red slices of cured beef leg shimmering with fennel seed oil, a plate of fresh ricotta with salty anchovies and toasted hazelnuts. 

Sandwich at any boulangerie — good baguette, good butter, and some thin slices of cured meats, preserved vegetables, or ——
