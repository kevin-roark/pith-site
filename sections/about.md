# Pith Supper Club and Home Goods

![](/images/43dd4362-f67a-45d7-ac5e-f859569c7298.jpeg) I started the Pith Supper Club while studying economics at Columbia University. While I still enjoy occasionally hosting strangers at my home for seasonal and social meals, the project has grown into a line of simple home goods that let anyone tap into the joy of do-it-yourself hospitality. Visit the [Pith Store](www.pith.store) to see what we make, where we’re stocked, access our small monthly drops of goods for online ordering, and check if supper club seats are available.

# Pzaz®

## **Instant energy in your pocket ✨**

[Pzaz](http://www.pzaz.com) is a pocketable zero-calorie mist packed with natural caffeine, electrolytes, and insanely delicious flavors. It’s more effective, fun, shareable, and environmentally friendly than any existing energy product.

I started the company because I wanted to create a consumable product that could thrive at the places where I most frequentl.

Visiting hundreds of convenience stores and speaking to thousands of their customers, I became obsessed with the uncompetitive, gross, unsafe, and unappealing world of energy shots.

I developed Pzaz with a team of experts who share my obsession with revitalizing a truly dead retail category  and redefining what it means to be energized. We manufacture in the United States (with an old regional manufacturer for 5 Hour Energy, in fact) and currently sell  at hundreds of stores in the New York area. We are lucky to be supported by an array of inspiring founders and investors. <br/><br/>
