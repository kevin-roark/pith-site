# Pith Supper Club and Home Goods

![](/images/43dd4362-f67a-45d7-ac5e-f859569c7298.jpeg) I started the Pith Supper Club while I was an economics student at Columbia University. I still enjoy sporadically hosting strangers at my home for seasonal and social meals, but Pith has grown into a small line of simple home goods that let anyone tap into the joy of do-it-yourself hospitality. Visit the [Pith Store](www.pith.store) to see what we make, where we’re stocked, access our monthly drops of goods for online ordering, and see if supper club seats are available.

# Pzaz® Caffeine Mist

![](/images/18e0207b-a0af-4091-a6d0-e4d0379fb843.jpeg)I  I would best build a large and successful company. Instead of focusing on high-end home cooking, I decided to apply by apply my experience with flavor, brand, and product development to the worst product I could find on the checkout counter of convenience stores: 5 Hour Energy.

Pzaz is a pocketable mist that delivers ultra-fast-acting bursts of positive energy. I designed it to be more effective, efficient, safe, shareable, delicious, and environmentally friendly than any energy drink or shot.

I developed it with a team of experts and founders who share my obsession with revitalizing a dead retail category  and redefining what it means to be energized. Pzaz is manufactured in the United States and currently sold exclusively at bodegas.
