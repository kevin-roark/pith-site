# Pith Supper Club and Home Goods

I started the Pith Supper Club while I was an economics student at Columbia University. I still sporadically host strangers at my home for seasonal and social meals, but mostly, I oversee the development of a small line of home goods that let anyone tap into the joy of do-it-yourself hospitality. Visit the [Pith Store](www.pith.store) to see what we make, where we’re stocked, access our monthly drops of goods for online ordering, and try your luck booking a seat at the supper club.

# Pzaz® Caffeine Mist

![](/images/18e0207b-a0af-4091-a6d0-e4d0379fb843.jpeg)Energy drinks are dumb, but energy shots are dead. I decided to apply my experience with flavor, brand, and product development to the worst thing I could find on the checkout counter of convenience stores.

Pzaz is a pocketable mist that delivers ultra-fast-acting bursts of positive energy. I designed it to be more effective, efficient, safe, shareable, delicious, and environmentally friendly than any energy drink or shot.

I developed it with a team of experts and founders who share my obsession with redefining what it means to be energized. It’s better in every way compared to energy drinks. Pzaz is manufactured in the United States and currently sold exclusively at bodegas.
