# Pith Supper Club and Home Goods

![](/images/43dd4362-f67a-45d7-ac5e-f859569c7298.jpeg) I started the Pith Supper Club while studying economics at Columbia University. While I still enjoy occasionally hosting strangers at my home for seasonal and social meals, the project has grown into a line of simple home goods that let anyone tap into the joy of do-it-yourself hospitality. Visit the [Pith Store](www.pith.store) to see what we make, where we’re stocked, access our small monthly drops of goods for online ordering, and check if supper club seats are available.

# Pzaz® Caffeine Mist

[Pzaz](Www.pzaz.com) is a pocketable mist that delivers instant positive energy. It is more effective, efficient, safe, fun, shareable, delicious, and environmentally friendly than any existing energy product.

I started working on Pzaz because I wanted to reimagine the worst food or beverage product I could find. After visiting hundreds of convenience stores and speaking to thousands of their customers, I realized that the murky and macho world of energy shots was wide open for competition.

I developed Pzaz with a team of experts who share my obsession with revitalizing a truly dead retail category  and redefining what it means to be energized. We manufacture in the United States and currently sell exclusively at bodegas. We are lucky to be supported by an array of inspiring founders and investors. <br/><br/>
