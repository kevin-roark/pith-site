### Hospitality Consultation

I received [three stars](https://www.chicagotribune.com/dining/ct-review-intro-jonah-reider-food-0928-20160924-column.html) from the Chicago Tribune for my menu development and implementation in residency at Intro Restaurant. I’ve developed menus for galas at The New Museum, advised Sam Adams Beer on flavor development, and executed private events with partners including Google, Stella Artois, Conde Nast, L’Oreal, and Land Rover.

[Reach out](mailto:inquiries@jonahreider.com) if you'd like to chat about a hospitality project, brand and product development, private events or collaborative pop-ups.

### Home Consultation

Cooking and dining spaces should be the focal points of any home. Contact me if you’d like help outfitting your home or private space with an eye towards relaxed cooking, pleasurable dining, and elegant entertaining. Based on your needs and space, I will recommend essential tools, small appliances, cutlery, tableware, lighting, audio equipment, and more.

### Education

Food and flavor are great lenses through which to examine political, economic, social, environmental, and physical well-being. I love showing young people, in or out of school, how cooking truly develops self confidence, self-expression, and civic engagement. In Brooklyn, from 2017-2018, I ran a free after-school program for middle-schoolers, using the Pith Supper Club venue to explore gardening, grocery shopping, dish development, and more.

Drawing from my economics education (focusing on inequality, sustainable development, business organization, and entrepreneurship), I’ve also spoken at institutions including Georgetown University and Stanford University, and participated in international development conferences in Abu Dhabi, Kuala Lumpur, and Fukuoka.

[Reach out](mailto:inquiries@jonahreider.com) if you'd like to chat about designing, implementing, and evaluating culinary arts education and food service standards. Improving public school lunches and food education is of particular interest to me. I'm also available for relevant speaking opportunities, panel moderation, or entrepreneurial consulting.

### Cannabinoids

Cannabis and hemp have a place in home entertaining routines and the hospitality industry generally. I am the founder and creative director of [Alto](www.altoessentials.com), the simplest and most delicious way for anyone to enjoy cannabinoids. Our curated daily essentials are infused gently with effective THC and CBD extracts, then packaged into unique single-serving packets. Learn more at [www.altoessentials.com](https://www.altoessentials.com), or [reach out](mailto:inquiries@jonahreider.com) with any inquiries about consultations and advisory services in the cannabis industry.

### Tours

I enjoy occasionally hosting private tours exploring a city's culinary and hospitality traditions, best farmer’s markets, hidden places for social dining, and more. Tours will be tailored to a groups’ interest, and can include a cooking class or demonstration. I am based in New York City but have facilitated tours in Tokyo, Paris, the Cote D'Azur — and enjoy researching and developing experiences for other locations as well.

### Art

Dining and hosting provides a unique opportunity to experience art: I love exploring how a meal can showcase beautiful furniture, glassware, ceramics, music, metalwork, and more. At my Pith Supper Club, I enjoy serving food on tableware made by my mother utilizing functional as well as nonfunctional artworks from friends.

[Reach out](mailto:inquiries@jonahreider.com) for inquiries related to curating or developing a gallery dinner, artist collaborations, or something else entirely surprising and edible.
