#### Home Consultation

Outfitting a home or private space? I help select private clients create beautiful and functional spaces centered around relaxed cooking, pleasurable dining, and elegant entertaining.

#### Education

Speaking engagements, workshops, educational programming, or institutional meal logistics? Food and flavor are great lenses through which to examine political, economic, social, environmental, and physical well-being.

In 2017-2018, I ran a free after-school program for middle-schoolers, using the Pith Supper Club venue to explore gardening, grocery shopping, dish development, and more.

Drawing from my economics studies in inequality, sustainable development, business organization, and entrepreneurship, I’ve also spoken at institutions including Georgetown University and Stanford University, and participated in international development conferences in the United States, Japan, Malaysia, and the United Arab Emirates.

#### Art

Gallery dinner? Artist collaborations? Making and serving food is a unique opportunity to experience art: I frequently showcase art through my supper club and events, and have enjoyed collaborating with multimedia artists, architects, musicians, galleries, and museums.
