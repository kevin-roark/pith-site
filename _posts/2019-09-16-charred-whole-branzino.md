title: Charred Whole Branzino
published: true

This recipe uses your broiler to make an exquisitely crispy whole fish with barely any prep or cleanup. I like using Branzino or other white bass in the same family, but you can use any whole fish that seems fresh, with clear black eyes and vivid purple gills.

No smoke, no mess — just delicate, lemony fish with a charred and bubbly exterior reminiscent of a fine Neapolitan pizza. I love to serve it next to a bowl of jammy roasted cherry tomatoes. A slightly messy pleasure to eat.

### Ingredients

Broiled Branzino _serves 4_

-   2 medium whole bass (ask for fish descaled with guts removed)
-   1/2 lemon, sliced thin and cut in half
-   3 cloves garlic, sliced thin
-   4 sprigs fresh thyme
-   1/4 cup olive oil
-   2 tsp salt
-   1 tsp freshly ground black peppercorn

Roasted Cherry Tomatoes _serves 4_

2 cups cherry tomatoes
3 cloves garlic
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp freshly ground black peppercorn
1 sprig thyme

### Preparation

First, gently fill the cavity of each cleaned fish with thin half slices of lemon, thin slices of garlic, fresh herbs, a spoonful of olive oil, and salt. Then, liberally season the entire exterior of each fish with olive oil and salt. If you can, place seasoned fish on an elevated rack atop a sheet pan. Regardless, let the seasoned fish sit in your fridge for up to twelve hours — the salt will penetrate the flesh, intensifying flavor while simultaneously drying the skin to ensure a crispy result.

About 40 minutes before you want to eat, turn on your oven’s broiler. This function turns my mediocre apartment oven into a dynamic and restaurant-quality cooking appliance — there’s intense direct flame and ultra high heat at the very top, with even roasting heat towards the bottom.

Mix all the ingredients for the Charred Tomatoes together in a small sheet pan and place towards the bottom of your oven. Roast for 30 minutes or so — the tomatoes should become impossible juicy and slightly charred, all without bursting and turning into tomato sauce. Oh — take the seasoned fish out of your refrigerator. It will cook more quickly and evenly when it’s closer to room temperature.

Fifteen minutes before eating, place the pan with seasoned branzino in your oven, very close to the direct broiler flame. Keep a close eye — we’re aiming for the face-up side of the fish to char and bubble without excessively burning, in about 5 minutes. At this point, gently flip the fish (it’s not going to stick if you used an elevated rack atop a sheet pan) and continue cooking until the second side is equally appealing. If your fish bubbles and chars within only one minute, your broiler is probably too hot and you’ll want to move the fish away from direct heat by a few inches. Serve immediately!

At a recent dinner, every one of my guests perfectly maneuvered a filet from the whole fish, leaving almost all the bones intact. It’s easier than it looks! If you’re having difficulty removing a clean spine, you probably need to throw the fish back in the oven for a few minutes. Whatever you do, don’t throw away the head — there are tasty nibbles of meat hidden within cheeks, and you can use the roasted head and bones to make a flavorful stock for another time…

For a full dinner party centered around this fish, simply add a sheet pan of small potatoes roasted slowly in the oven, or thick slices of sourdough briefly broiled to crusty perfection — both with a healthy glug of olive oil and nice, flaky salt. Instead of cherry tomatoes, you could alternatively char snap peas, corn, shishito peppers, or cauliflower in a similar fashion.
