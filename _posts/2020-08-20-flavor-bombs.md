#### My Freezer Is a Library of Homemade Condiments:

Water is the least interesting thing you can put in your ice-cube tray.

I just want to reach into the pantry and quickly prepare whatever looks easiest. And that’s ok! Lazy cooking is never bad when you’re armed with flavor bombs.

Although I don’t usually associate the freezer with intense flavor, I’ve been relying on mine to upgrade all sorts of tired dinnertime basics. In a spare ice cube tray, I freeze small pucks of various flavorful concoctions. I affectionately call them bombs because of their explosive impact on even the blandest of dishes.

With a bag full of these delicious little cubes, any five-minute meal can be spontaneously upgraded: simply cooked beans, grains, pastas, soup, and stews—basically anything that seems to need a little something to perk it up. And it all happens at a moment’s notice, with no mess to clean.

#### **You Don’t Need Any Fancy Equipment** 

Flavorful concoctions can be frozen in takeout containers or resealable plastic bags, but using an ice-cube tray creates nuggets that are perfectly portioned for spontaneous home cooking.

I prefer to use a [silicone ice-cube trays](https://amzn.to/3iZN2iO "(opens new window)"), which makes pleasingly symmetric cubes that are easy to remove once frozen. Honestly, though, any ice-cube tray will do.

Once equipped with an ice cube tray, the process is idiot-proof. I take practically any flavorful concoction—any paste, jam, juice, broth, purée, etc. — and freeze cubes of it until solid. Then, I pop the frozen pucks into a resealable plastic bag, where they remain protected from freezer burn until I call them into duty.

#### You Can Freeze Almost Anything

Almost anything becomes more useful when frozen into a pre-portioned nugget, but I have my favorites.

First, there are peak-season delicacies ripe for preservation in the freezer. Right now, for example, my markets are graced with [ramps](https://www.foodandwine.com/vegetables/ramps-recipes), green garlic shoots, and tender young ginger. I’ll make an infused oil with each one, freezing cubes of the result for yearlong bursts of springtime flavor. When I can get my hands on an aromatic bunch of basil, I’ll freeze flavor bombs out of [pesto](https://www.foodandwine.com/condiments/pesto-sauce/easy-pesto-sauce-recipes). In the summer, I’ll do the same with fruity hot chilies infused into vinegar. In the fall, I’ll sauté, blend, and freeze fresh porcini mushrooms.

Then, there are delicate ingredients that I tend to use in small quantities. Quality buttermilk, with its unique texture, tartness, and funk, makes for indispensable flavor bombs—so does freshly juiced citrus, whether it’s a couple of ripe lemons or ruby-red blood oranges. Without freezing these things into flavor bombs, I risk them losing flavor sitting indefinitely in my fridge.

Lastly, I like to deploy my ice-cube tray when I’m making any particularly complicated or time-consuming creations. Slowly [caramelized onions](https://www.foodandwine.com/cooking-techniques/how-caramelize-onions), carefully browned butter, deeply reduced stocks or broths, and homemade [curry pastes](https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/keow-wan-green-curry-paste)can be demanding to prepare. Why not make lots at once, then freeze individual chunks for easy use in the future?

#### Any Dish Is Better With a Flavor Bomb

Whatever you might freeze, its applications are nearly limitless, especially to otherwise uninspired pantry cooking.

A cube of frozen yogurt adds creaminess with a hint of tang to my morning smoothies. Cubes of browned butter will improve absolutely any cookie recipe, but I also use them to impart a warm depth to all types of [roasted vegetables](https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/roasted-vegetables-smashed-walnut-vinaigrette).

Those frozen nuggets of bright citrus juice make a great salad dressing when shaken hard with salt, pepper, and olive oil. Or, when slowly melted into a glass of cold sparkling water, you’ll enjoy a delicate, thirst-quenching soda.

Most of my flavor bombs, like pungent green garlic oil, are equally powerful whether melted into rice, beans, grains, soups, or stews. A puck of pesto melts into a perfect pasta coating, or could instead be folded into a bowl of slightly chewy cooked farro.

And nothing so quickly lets me add deep, sweet umami to a dish as does a little block of fudgy caramelized onions. Defrosted, I might just layer them into a sandwich. But in a pinch, nothing is better to enrich a soup, pasta, grain, bread, or bean.

The point is: whatever tired basics you’re turning to, don’t stress. Stock your freezer with some cubes of frozen creations, and big flavor is always within reach.
