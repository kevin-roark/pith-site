#### You only need three knives

Until you own a set of good knives, you can't understand the pleasure one feels from effortlessly slicing a plump tomato, cutting lemon wedges, sawing through a crusty loaf of bread, and filleting a fish.

Don't be tempted by fancy sets of eighteen knives — they will be lackluster, expensive, or both. Instead, create a versatile arsenal from  three unique yet indispensable knives.

I get my knives from [Korin](https://www.korin.com/), an amazing importer of Japanese cooking tools based in New York City, but you can find great knives for quick delivery online.

_Paring and Chef's Knife from Tojiro for $90_

### Big Knife

A hefty chef's knife, with a long blade equally suited for slicing and chopping, is my go-to knife 90% of the time in the kitchen.

I'd recommend the $32 [Victorinox](https://amzn.to/31NsAJf) for a great-value Western-designed chef's knife. This has been my workhorse knife for years.

And for Japanese blades, which are thinner, lighter, more precise, and require a bit more care — I'd recommend the accessable [Tojiro knives](https://amzn.to/2KA6T9Q), which are well priced and forged from top quality VG-10 steel core.

### Small Knife

A small paring knife allows for more complicated knifework, like removing the pith and seeds from a pepper, coring tiny strawberries, or deveining shrimp. A small knife is also great at the table for slicing fresh fruit or hard cheeses.

I used a great $8 [Victorinox 3.25" paring knife](https://amzn.to/2Hfyyee) for a long time, but recently upgraded to a [Japanese blade](https://amzn.to/2KA6T9Q) and noticed a significant upgrade in quality.

### Serrated Knife

Although you could use your nice new chef's knife to cut through crusty bread, ripe melons, or tender tomatoes, doing so would quickly dull its blade.

Instead, use a serrated toothed blade that you saw back and forth to quickly cut through difficult products. While, you definitely need a dependable serrated knife.

The beloved [Victorinox](https://amzn.to/2NdSy4D) model is about $30, although you can actually find an excellent lightweight uber-sharp Japanese option from [Tojiro](https://amzn.to/2YYrVHR) for slightly less.

These three — big, small, and serrated — are all the knives any home cook really needs. Keep them sharp, and use them properly, and I'm certain you'll find your home cooking and hosting routines immensely elevated.

#### Keep 'em sharp

Keep your treasured blades happy by investing in:

### Honing Steel:

[![Hand honing a kitchen knife against a honing steel](https://images.wisegeek.com/chef-in-white-with-knife.jpg){:.medium}](https://amzn.to/31Q4T3b)  
In daily use, any blade develops tiny tears, bends, and misalignment. Though perhaps visually imperceptable, these kinks create unnecesary friction and misalignment, making a blade feel much less sharp as you slice across its entire length.

![Animation of using a honing steel, making a cutting motion with the knife along the honing surface, at a close angle to the steel length](https://blades.guru/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Animated-GIF-original-3.mp4)

A honing steel, like [this one](https://amzn.to/31Q4T3b), doesn't sharpen your blade, but rather realigns it. Get in the habit of honing your blade every time they're significantly used — you'll be shocked at how refreshed your knives constantly feel.

Also, never **ever** put your knives in the dishwasher — they will get dull in no time. Instead, just wipe knives clean with warm water after each use. Dry them completely with a cloth before putting them away.

### An annual sharpening

While you can get sharpening stones to truly sharpen the blade every month or so, I would reccomend that most people simply take their knives to a professional sharpener twice a year or so. I have sharpening stones but still choose to pay $20 per knife every year to completely resharpen them. Make sure the sharpener uses high quality Japanese sharpening stones, not a brute force sharpening on a giant industrial machine.

Don't bother sharpening your serrated knives. As long as you're always sawing back and forth and not pressing directly down into super hard things, it will dull very slowly. And serrated knives are always really well priced — after a few years of use you can recycle yours in favor of a replacement.

### A great cutting board

[![Black cutting board](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41o5rVDlWwL._SL1200_.jpg){:.medium}](https://amzn.to/2Zdu2CR)  
Unless you have a beautiful butcher's block wooden countertop, you need a commercial-grade cutting board that's big enough to really work on and thick enough to steady any knife technique. I always use [this black cutting board](https://amzn.to/2Zdu2CR) because it doesn't get discolored with use.

### Knife Sleeves

[![Knife sleeves of various sizes](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1cnRPRCmtL._SL1500_.jpg){:.medium}](https://amzn.to/2YWVWYI)  
Instead of a clunky wooden block taking up countertop space with eighteen things you may or may not use, just place your knives in a convenient drawer, using simple [knife sleeves like these ones](https://amzn.to/2YWVWYI) that guard the blade, keep it dry, and protect your fingers.

#### Use them properly

Fancy new tools won't give you good knife skills. Even if , upgrading your knife technique is free and will improve the efficacy of any knives you already have. [Learning To Cook Food](http://www.learningtocookfood.com/knife-skills-gif-guide/) has an amazing collection of GIFs about proper knife technique. I use these same techniques in order to stay safe, efficient, and clean with my cuts.
